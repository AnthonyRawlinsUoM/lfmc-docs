Error Reporting
===============

Should you encounter a error, omission or reproducible bug please contact [Anthony Rawlins](mailto:anthony.rawlins@unimelb.edu.au) at University of Melbourne.

Inline error reporting is as simple as clicking the green *OK* button on reported errors. Clicking *Cancel* will not send a bug report.

All logged and reported errors automatically create an issue on the appropriate Github Repository, allowing for [Issue Tracking](https://github.com/AnthonyRawlinsUoM/LFMC/issues). You can also use the same page to add Feature Requests.
