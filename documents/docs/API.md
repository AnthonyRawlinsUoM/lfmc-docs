# API

Intended as a component to the LFMC Server Ecosystem. This is an image that answers Temporal Queries to form Time-series data in JSON format for subsequent analysis of Landscape Fuel Moisture Condition.

Also collects input data from a variety of sources and starts ingestion tasking on the cluster.
Processes, Models and TS Data are all exposed through a *RESTful API*.

The API is intended to be self-documenting and the endpoint can be queried using curl or similar commands. Hug is used for API development and Hug also naturally exposes a WSGI-Compatible API ready for production use.

    $ curl http://api.landscapefuelmoisture.bushfirebehaviour.net.au/v1
