# LFMC v3.1.2

The [School of Ecosystem and Forest Sciences (SEFS)](https://ecosystemforest.unimelb.edu.au/) from the [University of Melbourne (UOM)](http://www.unimelb.edu.au) was engaged by the [Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP)](http://delwp.vic.gov.au) to synthesise existing LFMC research into a single operational system for evaluating landscape fuel moisture condition. The project will represent the best available science in Australia in a single operational system. Outputs of this project, and their integration into state-agencies’ bushfire prediction and fuel monitoring systems, will greatly improve Victoria’s ability to prevent, prepare and respond to bushfires.

**PLEASE NOTE: DOCUMENTATION IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT**
