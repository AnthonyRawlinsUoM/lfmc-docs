# LFMC v3.1.2

**PLEASE NOTE: DOCUMENTATION IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

Over the past four years, across Victoria and New South Wales, a substantial sum has been invested in research on landscape moisture assessment, dynamic moisture modelling and ground-based sensor moisture calibration. While this investment has resulted in a substantial improvement in the capacity to predict the Landscape Fuel Moisture condition (LFMC), these improvements have only occasionally been translated into operational use by the relevant agencies.  As a consequence, agencies have not benefited fully from their research investment.  An improved understanding of LFMC can have application in fire suppression, risk planning and emergency management, so there are tangible benefits to optimising the value of research done.  

## Audience
