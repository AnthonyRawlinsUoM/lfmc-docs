# LFMC Documentation

#### Requirements
[MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

### Building the documentation
To build the documentation run:

	$ mkdocs build --clean
	
Upload the contents of the entire site directory to wherever you're hosting your website from and you're done.

For specific instructions see: [Deployment Guide](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/)
